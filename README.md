First Web App Hello World

I basically don't know what I'm doing yet.  
I am programmatically inclined and realize the potential with fullstack web applications.  
I am getting started with Node.js, express.js, mongoose.js (MongoDB), and bootstrap.  
I've used C++ since middle-school to create basic recreations of various algorithms, GUI, and socket programming, but not much outside of that.
Bare with me through my journey should anyone stumble upon my likely unfinished work!
